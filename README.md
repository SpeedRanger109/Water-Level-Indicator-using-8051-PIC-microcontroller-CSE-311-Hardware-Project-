# Objective

The objective is to build a Water level monitor system using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. Our
device will detect the water level of the system(reservoir, tank e.t.c) and notify the user about
the current state. Our device will notify the user about the current state of the water level via an
LCD display.

# Applications
Our device can be implemented in,
* Water reservoirs to indicate water level.
* Water cooler, where there is a danger of motor burnout when there is no water in the radiator.
* Fuel tankers to indicate the fuel level of the system.
* A liquid level indicator in the huge containers in the industries

# Discussion
In this project, our main objective was to indicate the user water level state of the water reservoir
at a certain stage. Now from our project demonstration, we saw that it was capable of producing
desired outputs for appropriate water level inputs. Now although it produced desired output still
there are issues that need to be resolved. Here our buzzer system is not working at all. As it
would be a more convenient system if it had worked. Also, resetting the whole system was faulty
too.
Now our device is only in schematic form. So how well it performs at the implementation level is
still unknown. Also, our knowledge of limited electrical equipment is also a limitation for us. For
example, if we were familiar with different models of microprocessors and other electrical
components our implementation could have been more convenient, fast, cheap, and
sustainable. Our schematic diagram could also be improved, cheap, and more sustainable if our
knowledge of electrical equipment were not limited. Also, we were novices at using simulation
software(Proteus and Mikroc). If we were more experienced with these our implementation
would be a lot better. For example, we were having a hard time adding appropriate library files
in Mikroc for different electrical components. Also using system-defined functions, appropriate
ports to input and output was difficult. Also, the schematic diagram became a bit messy for
using a lot of wires. So troubleshooting and tracing wires were difficult too.
There are no such things in this world that can not be developed. Our device not an exception to
this as well. We could have added motor pumps which would have filled the reservoir. We could
have controlled the motor pump too. Implementation of this could lessen wastage of water. Also,
our indicator shows only four states of water level. We could have added a measurement device
to indicate water level more descriptively. Also, we could have added a memory device to record
information about the refill and release of valuable liquids to the reservoir. This would have
helped significantly in the industrial sector.
